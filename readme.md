### What is this app?
This app is supposed to save articles you want to read later. I know Safari already does this.

### Why though?
I wanted to try out SwiftUI and SFSymbols

### Whats left to do?
Currently the App operates with mock data and the app action extension to save articles is not implemented yet. Also data is not persisted.
